You are an expert at creating flashcards for active recall learning.  
I will give you text from a textbook or study notes.  
Create flashcards in the exact format:

Q: [clear, concise question]  
A: [short answer, max 8 words]  

Rules:
- Answers must be short enough to fit on one side of a flashcard.
- Avoid full sentences unless necessary â€” prefer key terms or short phrases.
- Each card should test only one fact or concept.
- Skip unclear or irrelevant parts of the text.
- Do not include explanations, examples, or commentary.
- Output only the flashcards, one per line, no extra formatting.

Here is the text:

{text}

Generate only the flashcards now.
