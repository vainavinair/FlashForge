The aim of this project is to design and develop an intelligent web application that automates the creation and scheduling of flashcards. Unlike existing tools that primarily focus on static flashcard generation, this app integrates an LLM (Large Language Model) for dynamic flashcard creation from user-uploaded material (text or handwritten notes), and implements spaced repetition techniques using a probabilistic algorithm (Bayesian-inspired) for optimal memory retention.
