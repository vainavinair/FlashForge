    " Understanding the Brain\n",
    " According to Marr (1982), understanding an information processing sys\n",
    "tern has three levels, called the levels ofanalysis:\n",
    " 1. Computational theory corresponds to the goal of computation and an\n",
    " abstract definition of the task.\n",
    " 2. Representation and algorithm is about how the input and the output\n",
    " are represented and about the specification of the algorithm for the\n",
    " transformation from the input to the output.\n",
    " 3. Hardware implementation is the actual physical realization of the sys\n",
    "tem.\n",
    " One example is sorting: The computational theory is to order a given\n",
    " set of elements. The representation may use integers, and the algorithm\n",
    " maybe Quicksort. After compilation, the executable code for a particular\n",
    " processor sorting integers represented in binary is one hardware imple\n",
    "mentation.\n",
    " The idea is that for the same computational theory, there may be mul\n",
    "tiple representations and algorithms manipulating symbols in that repre\n",
    "sentation. Similarly, for any given representation and algorithm, there\n",
    " may be multiple hardware implementations. We can use one of vari\n",
    "ous sorting algorithms, and even the same algorithm can be compiled\n",
    " on computers with different processors and lead to different hardware\n",
    " implementations.\n",
    " To take another example, '6', 'VI', and '110' are three different repre\n",
    "sentations of the number six. There is a different algorithm for addition\n",
    " depending on the representationused. Digital computers use binary rep\n",
    "resentation and have circuitry to add in this representation, which is one\n",
    "11.1 Introduction\n",
    " 231\n",
    " particular hardware implementation. Numbers are represented differ\n",
    "ently, and addition corresponds to a different set of instructions on an\n",
    " abacus, which is another hardware implementation. When we add two\n",
    " numbers in our head, we use another representation and an algorithm\n",
    " suitable to that representation, which is implemented by the neurons.\n",
    " But all these different hardware implementations-for example, we, aba\n",
    "cus, digital computer-implement the same computational theory which\n",
    " is addition.\n",
    " The classic example is the difference between natural and artificial fly\n",
    "ing machines: A sparrow flaps its wings; a commercial airplane does not\n",
    " flap its wings but uses jet engines. The sparrow and the airplane are\n",
    " two hardware implementations built for different purposes, satisfying\n",
    " different constraints. But they both implement the same theory, which is\n",
    " aerodynamics.\n",
    " Thebrainis onehardwareimplementationfor learningorpatternrecog\n",
    "nition. If from this particular implementation, we can do reverse engi\n",
    "neering and extract the representation and the algorithm used, and if\n",
    " from that in turn, we can get the computational theory, we can then use\n",
    " another representation and algorithm, and in turn a hardware implemen\n",
    "tation more suited to the means and constraints we have. One hopes our\n",
    " implementation will be cheaper, faster, and more accurate.\n",
    " Just as the initial attempts to build flying machines looked very much\n",
    " like birds until we discovered aerodynamics, it is also expected that the\n",
    " first attempts to build structures possessing brain's abilities will look\n",
    " like the brain with networks of large numbers of processing units, until\n",
    " we discover the computational theory of intelligence. So it can be said\n",
    " that in understanding the brain, when we are working on artificial neural\n",
    " networks, we are at the representation and algorithm level.\n",
    " Just as the feathers are irrelevant to flying, in time we may discover\n",
    " that neurons and synapses are irrelevant to intelligence. But until that\n",
    " time there is one other reason why we are interested in understanding\n",
    " the functioning of the brain, and that is related to parallel processing.\n",
    " 11.1.2\n",
    " Neural Networks as a Paradigmfor Parallel Processing\n",
    " Since the 1980s, computer systems with thousands of processors have\n",
    " been commerciallyavailable. The software for suchparallelarchitectures,\n",
    " however, has not advanced as quickly as hardware. The reason for this\n",
    " is that almost all our theory of computation up to that point was based\n",
    "232\n",
    " 11 Multilayer Perceptrons\n",
    " PARAllEL PROCESSING\n",
    " on serial, one processor machines. We are not able to use the parallel\n",
    " machineswe have efficientlybecause we cannot program themefficiently.\n",
    " There are mainly two paradigms for parallel processing: In Single In\n",
    "struction Multiple Data (SIMD) machines, all processors execute the same\n",
    " instruction but on different pieces of data. In Multiple Instruction Mul\n",
    "tiple Data (MIMD) machines, different processors may execute different\n",
    " instructions on different data. SIMD machines are easier to program be\n",
    "cause there is only one program to write. However, problems rarely have\n",
    " such a regular structure that they can be parallelized over a SIMD ma\n",
    "chine. MIMD machines are more general, butit is not aneasy taskto write\n",
    " separate programs for all the individual processors; additional problems\n",
    " are related to synchronization, data transfer between processors, and so\n",
    " forth. SIMD machines are also easier to build, and machines with more\n",
    " processors can be constructed if they are SIMD. In MIMD machines, pro\n",
    "cessors are more complex, and a more complex communication network\n",
    " should be constructed for the processors to exchange data arbitrarily.\n",
    " Assume now that we can have machines where processors are a lit\n",
    "tle bit more complex than SIMD processors but not as complex as MIMD\n",
    " processors. Assume we have simple processors with a small amount of\n",
    " local memory where some parameters can be stored. Each processor im\n",
    "plements a fixed function and executes the same instructions as SIMD\n",
    " processors; but by loading different values into the local memory, they\n",
    " can be doing different things and the whole operation can be distributed\n",
    " over such processors. We will then have what we can call Neural Instruc\n",
    "tion Multiple Data (NIMD) machines, where each processor corresponds\n",
    " to a neuron, local parameters correspond to its synaptic weights, and the\n",
    " whole structure is a neural network. If the function implemented in each\n",
    " processor is simple and if the local memory is small, then many such\n",
    " processors canbe fitted on a single chip.\n",
    " The problemnow is to distribute a task over a network of such proces\n",
    "sors and to determine the local parameter values. This is where learning\n",
    " comes into play: We do not need to program such machines and deter\n",
    "mine the parameter values ourselves if such machines can learn from\n",
    " examples.\n",
    " Thus, artificial neural networks are a way to make use of the parallel\n",
    " hardware we canbuildwith current technology and-thanks to learning\n",
    "they need not be programmed. Therefore, we also save ourselves the\n",
    " effort of programming them.\n",
    " In this chapter, we discuss such structures and how they are trained.\n",
    "11.2 The Perceptron\n",
    " 233\n",
    " Figure 11.1 Simple perceptron. Xj, j = 1, ...,d are the input units. XQ is the\n",
    " bias unit that always has the value 1. y is the output unit. Wj is the weight of\n",
    " the directed connection from input xj to the output.\n",
    " Keep in mind that the operation of an artificial neural network is a math\n",
    "ematical function that can be implemented on a serial computer-as it\n",
    " generallyis-and training the networkis not much different from statisti\n",
